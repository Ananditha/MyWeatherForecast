# 🌦️ MyWeatherForecast

A Python-based weather forecasting application that provides a **7-day forecast** for a given location.

## 📌 Project Description

This project uses weather data to generate a detailed 7-day forecast. The application is designed to be simple, user-friendly, and accessible for academic review.

Users can:

- Enter a location (e.g., city or coordinates)
- View daily weather predictions for the next 7 days
- See data such as temperature, humidity, wind, and conditions (rain/sun/cloud, etc.)
- Optionally export results (if supported)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- Any libraries used: `requests`, `json`, `matplotlib`, etc.
- (If applicable) Web framework: `Flask` / `Streamlit` / `Tkinter` for GUI
- (If applicable) Weather API: [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api), [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/), etc.
